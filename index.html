      </div class=p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class=p>
<ul>
  <div class=li>
    <li>Guatemala is a Central American country with a tropical climate</li>
    <li>Guatemala is a country with quite a high crime rate so safety is a must</li>
    <li>Be sure to watch out for the season when travelling to Guatemala as different types of weather can disallow you to enjoy certain landmarks within the country</li>
    <li>Try to stay away from mosquito hotspots as Guatemala hosts a variety of insect borne diseases</li>
    <li>If you are used to drinking tap water then do not do it here, instead drink bottled water as water in Guatemala may not be safe for consumption</li>
    <li>Some street food can be made in fairly unsanitary conditions</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>What is Interesting in Guatemala?</h2>
      <div class=p>
  <p>Guatemala is a country known for its beautiful volcanic landscapes and ancient mayan sites with the country possessing a few UNESCO world heritage sites such as "Tikal national park",
    which is one of the sites that holds the ruins of an ancient Mayan civilization and one of the others being the historical town of Antigua.
    Some other things you could do is ride the <a href:"https://www.worldnomads.com/explore/central-america/guatemala/chicken-buses-and-guatemala-transport"; target:"_blank";>"Chicken" bus</a> which is not filled with chickens but rather filled to the brim with plenty of people in the inside,
    or if you want to take a dip in some water then you can visit the natural monument of Semuc Champey in its turqoise coloured waters,
    for the coffee enthusiasts you can take a tour at the abundance of coffee farms around the country</p>
        
        <p>So from this small list of places Guatemala is quite a good country to go to if you are interested in natural features, ancient civilizations or a coffee enthusiast</p>
