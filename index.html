       <p>Guatemala has an unsurprisingly vast range of food which is not surprising considering how food is known within the regions of Central America and South America.
         Guatemala has no national dish but the food that comes as a worthy contender for such a title would be the pepian which is a meaty stew that often contains both fruits and vegetables with a lot of spices mixed into it, this is an example of fusion cuisine with this dish having Mayan and Spanish roots.
         Among the cheaper meals is the Pupusa which is a thick corn tortilla stuffed with a filling such as refried beans and cheese, the famous empanada which is a handy and portable snack which is basically a hand pie with vegetarian or meat fillings common throughout countries with spanish influence,
         Rellenitos which are deep fried plantains mixed up with refried beans sugar and cinammon this is one of their cuisine which revolves on the sweeter side. And one last fast about the cuisine, Guatemala is known as the birhtplace of chocolate as cocoa has an enormous significance within mayan culture being used as a currency in the previous times.</p>
